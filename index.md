## What Do These Principles Mean to You?

---

<small>
* *Findable* - easy for both humans and computers
  * F1. (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier
  * F2. Data are described with rich metadata (defined by R1 below)
  * F3. Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe
  * F4. (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource
* *Accessible* - clear how to access
  * A1. (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardised communications protocol
    * A1.1 The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable
    * A1.2 The protocol allows for an authentication and authorisation procedure, where necessary
  * A2. Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available
* *Interoperable* - integrated with other data
  * I1. (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.
  * I2. (Meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles
  * I3. (Meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data
* *Reusable* - well-described for re-deployment
  * R1. Meta(data) are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes
  * R1.1. (Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license
  * R1.2. (Meta)data are associated with detailed provenance
  * R1.3. (Meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards
