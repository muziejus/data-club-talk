## Data Club

1. “Monday Meetings” met nine times
2. “Intro to Data with (Python|R)” occurred nine times as well
1. Participants included master’s students, librarians, PhD students, postdocs,
   and undergrads
1. Participants came from Statistics, Financial Engineering, History, CS, and
   English

---

## Intro to Data with (Python|R)

1. Language “agnostic”
1. Teaches different data structures
1. Teaches simple visualization of tabular data

---

## Monday Meetings

1. Introductions and discussions on advanced beginner topics in data
1. Presentation led by an intern followed by Q&A and some hands on work

---

## Monday Meeting Topics

1. Computational Classification (aka “Machine Learning”): _ML algorithms,
   TensorFlow, unsupervised ML, interpretable ML, recurring neural networks_
1. Geospatial data management: _Geopandas_
1. Geospatial data visualization: _Geopandas, Leaflet for R_
1. Data visualization: _Ggplot2, Matplotlib_

---

## Reports

1. Interns drafting four reports on Data Club
1. Our view:
  * Better time (Monday hard to advertise)
  * Better outreach (table tents, blackboards)
  * Clearer delineation that the MMs are intro-level and Intro to Data is
  _super_ intro-level.
  * More workshop/hands-on atmosphere
